The API is completely implemented.

Some shortcuts I took would be some code found on the internet, for example the isNumeric function at the end of the stackController.

Improving the API would mean finding flaws, and correct them, for example discovering that an endpoint does not work in some circumstances.
More error messages would be an improvement.
