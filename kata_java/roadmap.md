To improve this API

- Stack could belong to someone in particular;
- This someone, when checking the existing stacks, would only see his/hers;
- implement token authentication;
- implement other operands (square for example would only take the last value of a stack);
- exponent operator would also be possible;
- same for square root/other roots.
- Maybe a special endpoint to send a json file to compose en entire stack more easily.
